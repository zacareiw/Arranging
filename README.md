# Arranging 
Program that takes in as input a melody and returns a 4 part jazz harmonized version of that melody. Users can choose to harmonize the melody with whichever chord they choose. 

### Current Improvements: 
Implementing 5 different classes representing 5 different qualities of chords. 

### Future Improvements: 
Taking a note and chord quality as input and returning a harmonized inversion of that chord.
